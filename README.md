Basic dice app just to get back into the flow with Swift and WatchKit. Nothing fancy.

Starts with the most basic possible WatchKit die:
* One D6 as a button
* Tap to re-roll
* Images are from an old project, not high quality art dice symbols

Added iOS app to go with WatchKit app:
* Six D6 dice
* Tap a die to re-roll it
* Shake to re-roll all dice
* Same old (low-quality) art
